LabData is a class designed to analyze the transition regime in a Lean, Premixed, and Prevaporized (LPP) two-stage combustor. It primarily focuses on processing pressure signals from sensors located at the injector point.

The class includes functions to extract key transition characteristics, such as:

Staging factor at the transition point

Transition type

Regime classification labels
